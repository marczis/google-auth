### What is this repository for? ###

A very simple script to store google authenticator keys and generate keys. Codes are stored in a encrypted file, still, I recommend to keep those files on an encrypted device. The oauth module is from the Internet, unfortunately I can't find the author, I will do my best to identify him and give credits for his work.

This SW is free of charge in every meaning and it comes with absolutely no guarantee.

Please feel free to use and share.  

### Setup ###
The script uses only one file, which will be located in ~/.gauth/keys. At first time you add a token, provide the master password - that's gonna be your master password after. Obviously if you loose that you loose your MFA. So keep it safe. And do regularly back it up to a safe location.

### TODOs ###
Well user interface is not nice at all. I just created this script as a backup of my phone authenticator, as I recently lost some tokens with phone....
